            Tagore Hall is named after Rabindranath Tagore, the renowned poet, writer, composer, and the first non-European Nobel laureate. The residence embodies his philosophy that emphasizes the importance of creativity, cultural exchange, and harmony with nature.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Our hall attracts students from diverse fields who share a common interest in the arts and humanities. The unique architecture features spaces that transition seamlessly between indoors and outdoors, creating an environment that stimulates creative thinking and expression.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Residents benefit from mentorship programs with faculty from the Arts and Humanities departments, as well as visiting artists and writers who regularly participate in hall activities. Many graduates cite their time in Tagore Hall as pivotal to their creative development.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The hall maintains a rich tradition of publishing a literary magazine each semester featuring poetry, short stories, essays, and artwork created by residents. Selected works are showcased in the annual Tagore Arts Festival, which has become a highlight of the university's cultural calendar.
